        <p>This page is a dedication to those that I believe contributed greatly to the platform. It would be unacceptable to disregard their contributions to Shinobi.</p>
<p>The people mentioned on this page, I have no clue whether or not they identify themselves as <i>Shinobi Devs</i>.. but <i>they are awesome Shinobi Devs</i>. Without them Shinobi would not be what it is now and what it will hopefully become.</p>
<p>Thank You from Moe Alam.</p>
