      "page__content": "<h2>\n    Before Reading\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <i>Please be aware this is all based on my experiences with ZoneMinder.&nbsp;Much of this can be seen as just an opinion. Whether it's a good one or not is up to you.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Firstly, Why does ZoneMinder matter to me?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <i>I want to make a world class CCTV platform. One that anyone can use. I scoured the internet for months for a place to start and only finding ZoneMinder as the answer over and over. Even my own brother was suggesting it. After using it and studying the code for 2+ years I was met with frustration. Developer arrogance coupled with poorly written code.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In short I spent a lot of time and energy on something that didn't work and It frustrated me.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    MJPEG streams are outdated\n</h2>\n<p>\n    With MJPEG you are opening a new stream every time you create an image with an MJPEG url. Even if you remove this element it will continue to eat resources from the server and client. Only way to deal with it currently is through an iframe, popup, or hard refresh.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi addresses this with Websocket streams. As frames are captured by FFMPEG they are base64 encoded and sent to the client. Shinobi can also output HLS (m3u8), MJPEG (in an iframe), and JPEG (on a timer).</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    MJPEG streams are limited in many browsers. About 6-8 Streams maximum. Unless you turn off this limitation in the browsers settings, but of course mobile doesn't normally have this option exposed to users.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>In Shinobi you don't have to worry about that with Bas64 or JPEG streams you can trick the browser into just letting you do it anyway. Base64 is technically using 1 pipe to the client, the Websocket. While JPEG is just refreshing an image on a timer.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    JPEG Storage is awful\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Saving each frame as a separate file in JPEG format can have a seriously detrimental effect on storage space and the hardware itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi saves to WebM and MP4 files. While MP4 takes a fair amount of space.. its level of CPU usage during encoding for H.264 streams is just amazing.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Using too many languages\n</h2>\n<p>\n    The platform uses Perl, PHP, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and probably more. This makes it difficult to modify the code for other purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. Simple right? It should be.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Outdated methods\n</h2>\n<p>\n    While connected to the dashboard it will query the database for events every few minutes, continuously getting/counting the same events over and over.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses Websockets to get real-time data about Videos and Events.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    For every camera a new process is created every time a viewer opens a stream. 1 Stream = 1 Process. So if you had 1 Camera with 3 Streams open, you would have 3 processes active for each viewer.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses 1 process per camera for all viewers.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Multiple windows and pages for simple things. For example the monitor settings window. It has multiple pages. Even though each page has a fixed set of options, <b>all inputs are present on the page. They are just hidden.</b> If they were going to do that they may as well have made it use JavaScript to show and hide fields appropriately. Rather than send a request to the server on each page change.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi has it all in one window, which is loaded on dashboard load. The fields are populated based on the camera selection. Even then the camera details are stored in the memory of the client browser to easily load data without an additional request to the server.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    As mentioned previously ZoneMinder uses&nbsp;Perl, PHP and C++. These languages are powerful, no doubt. The issue is in their use. C++ will require building of components, which makes updating a pain. PHP is fully synchronous, which makes client operations a pain for you and for the system it runs on.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses JavaScript, this allows users to simply overwrite the older Shinobi files with the new ones, restart the processes and you are updated. Since JavaScript is asynchronous and has the ability to pipe data, we are left with little overhead when it actually comes to the node application itself.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Telemetry (Remote User Tracking)\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Quoted from the source code \"This script collects usage information of the local system and sends it to the ZoneMinder development team. This data will be used to determine things like who and where our customers are, how big their systems are, the underlying hardware and operating system, etc.\" - <a href=\"https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/blob/254fcbcef790c0db11cd845548cd0383b7660e90/scripts/zmtelemetry.pl.in\">ZoneMinder/scripts/zmtelemetry.pl.in</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>You can turn this feature off. Although it should have never been made in the first place or at least turned off by default. From a developer standpoint this a great idea but some people may not like their information being logged somewhere to be possibly stolen then used maliciously. Paranoid? perhaps. All that matters is there are a few who don't want it and may not realize it is there. We don't know if other parts of the code are sending other kinds of data. To even wonder is a bother. Shinobi has no such integration and it never will.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>The added issue to this being a third party controls this data. The original author is not the one who stores it. Literally anyone can become a core member of the platform tomorrow and leak all the information 10 minutes after that.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Conclusion\n</h2>\n<p>\n    In less than a year Shinobi has more than half the features of ZoneMinder. I'm not special or trained in programming, I learned at home - in my mom's basement. When someone cares about something they will give their time and effort for that. I care about Shinobi, that is why it has progressed so quickly.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Protect what is precious to you as you live long and prosper.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Learn more about Shinobi on the <a href=\"http://shinobi.video/why\">Why</a> page.\n</p>\n<p>\n    See a comparison of features for&nbsp;<a href=\"/features#learn\">ZoneMinder to Shinobi</a>.\n</p>"

One that anyone can use. Simply login to your account, add camera details, set options, and away you go. No client app installations. Viewing streams and recordings on your mobile device by simply opening a web page.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You should be able to view it on any device with a capable web browser. A base was needed to start with so I took to the internet for more answers.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After much searching one popular CCTV application born in 2003 was the primary choice but found it wasn't capable of fulfilling the role.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To get a detailed outline of the most popular solution check out \"<a href=\"/articles/2017-07-29-why-not-just-use-zoneminder\">Why not just use ZoneMinder</a>\".\n</p>\n<h2>\n    General issues with the present solutions\n</h2>\n<p>\n    You might find the current solutions with a mix of the problems listed below.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Poorly written code\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Missing key features\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Written in obscure or old language\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Ugly interface\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Poor maintenance\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Too expensive\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Not open source\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Requires client to install application\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Does not run on multiple platforms\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n    I want to eliminate these issues\n</h2>\n<p>\n    So I started the base of my vision. I worked on it for about 1 week alone in my dark room before I decided to one day pop open the working prototype on my brother's computer. He liked what he saw and asked me \"<b>Is this ZoneMinder?</b>\".. I gave him a big grin and said \"<b>nope</b>\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    I named it how I saw it. Shinobi (Ninja). One who watches from the shadows. Then threw it on Github and began my journey. I never really expected to make a replacement for the current self hosted solutions. It sort of just happened.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    \"So wait.. Shinobi is not what you wanted to make in the first place?\"\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Initially, no. I planned to make a cloud hosted service that would be better and more cost effective than the rest. Something that could be relied upon globally.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Shinobi is meant to be the framework of this platform. As mentioned already, no usable solution existed. So I had to make one from the beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In a sense I have met the criteria of what I wanted to do. I have achieved my goal, just in a different way. It is used around the world and generally it is pretty simple for how powerful it has become.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying the ride\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Shinobi has been an amazing experience so far. I have met amazing people, learned new things and did things I never imagined. The community made it this way. Node.js made it this way. My family made it this way... and so many more.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I am loving every moment that has been and I can't wait to see what's next. Thanks to everyone for helping make Shinobi what it is and what it will become.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Cheers!\n</p>"

You can blame us for being considerate but if there weren't anyone like us then things would be a lot worse.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I too tried to make Shinobi a paid application and it ended with people just wasting my time. Ultimately hurting my performance in maintaining Shinobi.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Take what happened to Nodemailer as a reminder why we shouldn't just take without giving something in return.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Why maintaining without the author is bad\n</h2>\n<p>\n    ZoneMinder is an application where the original author left and look at the result today. For more information check out \"<a href=\"/articles/2017-07-29-why-not-just-use-zoneminder\" target=\"_blank\">Why not just use ZoneMinder</a>\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    Making a program is similar to raising a child. It takes time and effort to do it right.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Please consider contributing to Shinobi to ensure it not only stays alive, so that the code is not destroyed by those not ready to pick up the mantle. This said not referring to ability but to the amount of care and for what purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I am aware that one day I will grow old and die. In that time there will hopefully be someone who cares about Shinobi more than I do to keep it going.. but for now I am in the <b>spring time of youth!</b>\n</p>"

I haven't begun doing it simply by choice. I can monitor the download traffic to Shinobi Pro so if it starts getting crazy with little contribution then things will get <i>legal</i>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    I don't understand, Can I talk about this somewhere?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Sure! You can personal message me on Discord or fill out the Contact form with any concerns you may have.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A few users felt it was their duty to post in the Issues section when it was explicitly stated the issues section is only for bugs with the software, Not personal opinions or general discussion. Please don't do this.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    What about previous contributions by other users?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <b>On the official Contributing page, which is actually linked to from the Github Wiki, it is stated :</b><br><i>\"All contributed code becomes the property of Shinobi. All contributors give permission to Shinobi and Shinobi developers to use the code however it is seen fit. This is agreed upon when making your first commit.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    I have written this as simple as possible. As much as it is a restricting policy it makes maintaining the application simple. <b>The main premise of Shinobi is to keep things simple even when we are handling something complex.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Don't agree with these rules?</b> Then don't commit or make a pull request to remove your code. Understand though that you have already accepted these guidelines and we reserve the right to reject the request if the code is irreplaceable or needed to function, as the code now belongs to Shinobi. Once a \"reversion request\" is reviewed and accepted we will get into changing the code to not use your specified snippets.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    But isn't the code mine, since I wrote it?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    In your fork it is, that is what the GPL license actually covers. But due to the notice I put on the website anything that is contributed becomes property of Shinobi.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    But you can't just change the License, can you?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Yes I can actually. I could make the program closed source if I wanted to. I hold that right as the only copyright holder. Its just that all previous versions and any version from CE will not be held under any changes to the license. The copy you have with GPLv3 is always going to be GPLv3.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    How I feel about all this\n</h2>\n<p>\n    I love Shinobi. I want to share it with everyone. That is why I released it for free to begin with... but things have changed. <b>I no longer have the luxury of giving things away. I tried doing a voluntary contribution program but that didn't gain much traction.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the last week I have had a lot of my time wasted with users trying to negate what I have written on the site and have been berated by those who didn't even contribute. <a href=\"/articles/2017-08-01-nodemailer-is-no-longer-maintained\" target=\"_blank\">This happened to the guy who made Nodemailer as well.</a>&nbsp;I work hard on this platform. <b>I didn't pick up a fork and start editing it, I started from line 1.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Shinobi Pro is a paid application because I want to give back what I have been given and hopefully more.</b>\n</p>"
